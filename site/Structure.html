		It's always easiest to do something associated with a thing you're passionate about or familiar with.
		<br>
		As such, I will be documenting a story of such for my OldSchool RuneScape Ironman account.

			<p>This is the earliest screenshot I have that shows my stats.

				Early levels, not sure why I stopped firemaking at 79. I didn't get 99 until much later, but I think I just got <i>burnt</i> out by it.</p>
			<br>
				Obviously did the standard early game quests for various combat xp, but I really struggled with GP.
				Looting Steel Plates in deep wildy and selling to the shop was 100% a viable method in my eyes at the time.
			<br>
				I did do H.A.M Store Rooms too for GP, which is probably how I got these magic levels. I would frequently farm Tree Spirits for Nature Runes, thieve H.A.M Store Rooms, alch, repeat.
			<br>
				Eventually I graduated to agility pyramid and never looked back.
			<br>
			<div class="wrap_right">
				<br>
					I do remember grinding out 70 agility fairly early. I felt like the use of the agility pipe to the Blue Dragons in Taverly was worth the agility grind in the long run.

					I made some Falador tele tabs and would range with a bone crossbow to get the 45 prayer early on. This was painfully slow.
				<br>
			</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm not sure what quests I had done by this point, as the earliest screenshot I have available is this one of the Family Crest @ 117 QP's.
			<br>
				And was only 30 or so total levels after the first screenshot at the <a href="#early">top</a>.

				One thing that was actually quite enjoyable and something I would certainly repeat, was killing Chaos Druids in the Ardougne tower.
			<br>
				It was surprisingly really good early herblore xp, and stacked up very quickly.
			<br>
				It was also really easy combat training as they barely hit at all. Range and Melee stats trained here mostly until 60.
