            Linking to a file in the same directory as this HTML file is ez, bro. This is on the same line tho:
            <a href="Lists.html" target="_blank" title="Link to Lists page">Click Here for Lists, buddy</a>
        <br>
        <!-- For links on a new line, see below where to put the div or span tags. Inside the final a tag, after the link title closing bracket i.e. "..> <div> </div> </a>"
        this causes the link to not be covered by CSS rules that refer to <a> tags alone. See CSS comments. -->
            <br>Alternatively, on this new line...
            <a href="Lists.html" target="_blank" title="Link to Lists page">
            <span>Click here for Lists, buddy</span></a>
            <br> See, you need the div or spanINSIDE the &lt;a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; tags to get it on a new line

    <u>External Links</u>

        Linking to an external reference is just as ez, bro:

                1) Image is inside a folder where the current html files are located 
                    i.e. /site/ contains the html files and the folder Pictures.
                    Since the Pictures folder is in the current folder of the html, you do not need the main root (/site/, or the '/' in front). Just name the folder and sub-folders etc
                2) When the source folder is in the previous root directory, you can use "<img src="../picture.jpg">"    
                3) When it's in the same folder as the htmls, just <img src="picture.jpg"> -->
