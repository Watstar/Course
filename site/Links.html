    <section id="section4"><h3>So, what now?</h3>
    <h4>Singh, of Selan Gardens, Hayes, is currently in prison after being sentenced by Worcester Crown Court on April 13.

        <div>According to the Crown Prosecution Service, when a case is ordered to lie on file it means there is no verdict so proceedings are not formally terminated.
        </div>
        <div>There can be no further proceedings against the defendant on those matters without permission from the crown court or the Court of Appeal.
