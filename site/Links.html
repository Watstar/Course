    <!-- target="_blank" forces links to open in a new tab -->
    <section><div>
        Linking to a file in the same directory as this HTML file is ez, bro. This is on the same line tho:
        <a href="Lists.html" target="_blank" title="Link to Lists page">Click Here for Lists, bitch</a></div>
    <br>
    <!-- For links on a new line, see below where to put the div tags. Inside the final a tag, after the link title closing bracket i.e. "..> <div> </div> </a>"-->
        <div>Alternatively, on this new line...</div>
        <a href="Lists.html" target="_blank" title="Link to Lists page">
        <div>Click here for Lists, biatch</div></a>
             See, you need the div INSIDE the &lt;a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; tags to get it on a new line

                    i.e. /site/ contains the html files and the folder Pictures.
                    Since the Pictures folder is in the current folder of the html, you do not need the main root (/site/, or the '/' in front). Just name the folder and sub-folders etc
                2) When the source folder is in the previous root directory, you can use "<img src="../picture.jpg">"    
                3) When it's in the same folder as the htmls, just <img src="picture.jpg"> -->
